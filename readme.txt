A simple WordPress analytics plugin that is GDPR compliant, lightning fast, and an alternative to Google Analytics.

== Description ==

**[Independent Analytics](https://independentwp.com/?utm_source=WordPress.org&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=ReadMe.txt&utm_content=Top)** is a GDPR-friendly website analytics plugin made exclusively for WordPress. Give it a try if you're ready for a Google Analytics alternative.

**This is a free plugin and doesn't require you to create an account on another site**. All features outlined below are included in the free plugin.

**Main Features:**

* Analytics dashboard inside your WP admin
* Shows your most popular posts and pages
* Lists your top traffic sources
* Geodata with interactive world map
* Device report with device types, browsers, and OS
* Virtually zero performance impact
* GDPR compliant

> **PRO version now available**
> **[Independent Analytics Pro](https://independentwp.com/pricing/?utm_source=WordPress.org&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=ReadMe.txt&utm_content=Pro+Intro)** adds Campaign URLs, Real-time analytics, WooCommerce integration, and email reports. It's on sale for a limited time at 45% off.

**Beautiful & Customizable Dashboard**

Independent Analytics adds a full-featured analytics dashboard into your WP admin. The analytics dashboard shows you:

* **Quick Stats** show you the total views & visitors
* **Visual Chart** shows you traffic for each day
* **Data Table** includes every page that's received a visit

You can also sort and filter your data by any column, such as the page type, author, publication date, title, and more.

**The ONLY analytics tool with full WordPress integration**

Independent Analytics is different from Google Analytics and other analytics WordPress plugins.

Other tools show you a list of URLs alongside their metrics. Independent Analytics can show you the title of every page, the page type, the author, the publication date, the categories, and more, all alongside metrics like Views and Visitors.

We call it a [page-based analytics tool](https://independentwp.com/knowledgebase/common-questions/page-based-analytics/).

**No more copy & pasting tracking codes**

Just install the plugin, and tracking starts right away. You don't need to mess with any tracking codes, edit your site's head element, or create an account elsewhere.

**GDPR Compliant**

Independent Analytics is GDPR compliant out-of-box. Here's what makes it privacy-friendly:

* Does not use cookies
* Does not store personally identifiable information
* Data is created and stored entirely on your server

Since Independent Analytics uses cookie-less tracking, you don't need to add a cookie popup to your site.

**Top traffic sources**

Find out where your site visitors are coming from with the Referrer report. It shows you:

* Every website that sent you a visitor
* Automatic detection for popular search engines and social sites
* Filter and sort referrers however you want.

Using the traffic analytics, you'll quickly figure out which marketing tactics are working and which ones aren't.

**Geolocation report**

Find out where your visitors are located with the [Geolocation dashboard](https://independentwp.com/features/geographic-data/). It includes the following data for every visitor:

* Continent
* Country
* Subdivision/Region
* City

Like other reports, you can set a custom date range, sort, and filter the results.

**Data portability**

As an analytics WordPress plugin, your data is collected and stored entirely on your servers. This means you can:

* Backup your analytics every time you backup your site
* Transfer your analytics to any domain
* Export your data to CSV whenever you want

Unlike the other analytics solutions that use your URLs, Independent Analytics keeps track of your pages, so if you transfer to a new domain, you won't see any difference in your analytics - the URLs will automatically update to match the new domain.

**Who's it for?**

Independent Analytics is easy enough for a total beginner to use while still offering tools for deep data analysis for any WordPress website.

* **Bloggers:** use Independent Analytics as a simple blog stats plugin. Find out how many views your posts get and how much traffic you get from search engines and social media.
* **eCommerce stores:** track views and visitors for your WooCommerce products and find out which countries visit your site the most.
* **News sites:** get same-day statistics for all your posts and filter by author to find your most successful writers.
* **Startups:** start tracking your visits right away and find out which early marketing tactics are driving results.

**All Features**

Our WordPress statistics plugin is more robust than a simple hit counter and includes all of the following features:

* Simple analytics dashboard
* Views and Visitors metrics
* Filter your analytics by page type
* Instantly sort the data table
* Pick custom date ranges
* One-click pre-defined date ranges
* Dashboard widget for quick referencing
* Daily site views tracking
* Referrer tracking & report
* Device types and browsers
* Ignore views from logged-in users

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this use Google Analytics? =
No, Independent Analytics is an alternative to Google Analytics.

= Can I use Independent Analytics and Google Analytics at the same time? =
Yes, you can run them both simultaneously without any issues or errors.

= Will it slow down my site? =
No, the tracking script is only 2kb and is inlined to the page, so there will be virtually zero difference in your site's performance after installing Independent Analytics.

= Does tracking start right away? =
Yes, the moment you install Independent Analytics it will start tracking views. If you don't see any views right away, clear your site's cache and then visit your site in a private browser tab to record your first view.

= What metrics does it track? =
It tracks Views, Visitors, Referrers, and the approximate location of your visitors.

= Do I need to use a cookie popup with it? =
No, Independent Analytics does not use cookies.

= Is there a tracking code? =
Yes, but you don't have to add it yourself. It gets included on all of your site's pages automatically once Independent Analytics is activated.

= Does it work if I use Matomo? =
Yes, Independent Analytics will run smoothly and won't create any errors even if you're already using Matomo or any other analytics plugin.

= Are bot visits counted? =
We use best practice techniques to filter out bot visits as efficiently as possible. If you compare to traffic from Google Analytics, you'll find that your views and visitors are very similar. If you need to further eliminate bots from getting counted, we recommend adding a Firewall with Cloudflare.
